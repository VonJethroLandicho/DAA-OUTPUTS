"""
Population vs. GDP Growth Visualization (2014â€“2023)

Description:
-------------
This script visualizes the relationship between the total population and GDP growth rate in a scatter plot 
for the years 2014 to 2023. It combines male and female population data to compute total population values 
and maps them against corresponding annual GDP growth percentages.

Main Functionalities:
---------------------
- Calculates total population by summing male and female populations per year.
- Plots a scatter chart of total population vs. GDP growth rate.
- Annotates each data point with the year and its GDP value.
- Computes and plots a linear trendline using NumPy for visual regression analysis.
- Calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between population and GDP growth.
- Displays the correlation value on the chart title and prints it in the console.

Intended Use:
-------------
Useful for analyzing potential trends or correlations between demographic growth and economic performance over a 10-year period.
